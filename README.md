# french-teacher
A voice assistant that listens to an English topic, retrieves a short summary from Wikipedia in English, translates it into French, prints it to the console, and reads it aloud using gTTS. It uses speech recognition for input, Wikipedia API for data, Google Translate for translation, and runs in a loop until the user says “exit” or similar.
